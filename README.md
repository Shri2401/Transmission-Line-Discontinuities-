# Transmission Line Discontinuity Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the effects of return path discontinuities induced by slots in transmission lines and proposes a solution to mitigate them. The methodology involves the strategic introduction of additional capacitance via patches to stabilize impedance, as demonstrated by Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) responses.

## Key Features
- Method development to address return path discontinuities in transmission lines.
- Mitigation solution through strategic introduction of additional capacitance via patches.
- Comprehensive analyses of transmission line parameters using Ansys HFSS and Altium Designer.
- Practical measurement validation using Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and Keysight ADS.
- Emphasis on controlling geometries and dimensions to manage characteristic impedance effectively and minimize impedance variability.
